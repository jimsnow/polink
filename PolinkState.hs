-- We use lenses to make state manipulation simpler, though a problem with
-- both acid-state and lenses is that they are both set up to work well
-- with the State monad, but here I use EitherT State.  There's consequently
-- a bit of extra complexity, and there are a lot of potential errors that
-- ought to throw exceptions, but instead fail silently.
